## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict whether a loan will be approved or not based on applicant details. This involves using classification algorithms and comparing their performance.

### Key Features
- Preprocessing techniques for handling missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
- Feature engineering and scaling.
- Implementation of machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest).
- Performance evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes various features about loan applicants such as:
- **ApplicantIncome**: Income of the applicant
- **CoapplicantIncome**: Income of the coapplicant (if any)
- **LoanAmount**: Total loan amount
- **Loan_Amount_Term**: Duration of the loan
- **Credit_History**: Credit history (0/1)
- **Property_Area**: Area type (Urban/Rural/Semiurban)
- **Loan_Status**: Target variable indicating loan approval (Y/N)

The dataset can be found [here](#).

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

You can install all dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-approval-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the directory and run the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
cd loan-approval-prediction
jupyter notebook Loan_Approval_Prediction.ipynb
```

3. Run the notebook to execute the data processing, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated based on the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions.
- **Precision**: The proportion of true positive predictions.
- **Recall**: The ability of the model to find all the relevant cases.
- **F1-Score**: A harmonic mean of precision and recall.

The final model shows the best performance in terms of [your chosen metric].
